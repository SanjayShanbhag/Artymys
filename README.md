Artymys is my attempt at creating a full fledged social media website. This was back when I was first introduced to Web Application Development.
Artymys boasts as many features as any other platform. Feed, follow, appluad/censure, comments, polls, and many more:

Login/Signup

A personal account is a must for any social medai platform isn't it?

Personalised Feed

As soon as you login, you get a personalised feed based on the preferences such as the genres you like and the other users that you follow. The stories are ranked based on an algorithm that takes into account the score of a particular story(applauds,censures,rating,etc) and also the time decay so that the fresh stories always have a higher precedence.

Follow/Unfollow

You can follow and unfollow other users on the platform. Once you follow, you will begin seeing more of their stories on your feed.

Applaud/Censure

Once you like a story you read you have the option of applauding its writer. This is similar to Facebook's Like/Dislike. More Applauds will help the story move on the top of other people's feed.

Ratings

Besides applauds and censures you can also rate the story out of 5. These ratings also go a long way in determining their ranks on people's feeds.

Write new/ Edit existing story

Well, this has to be the crux of the application. Writing or updating stories on the platform is how it works. And the platform has a user friendly UI with a nice HTML editor to allow you to do just that.

Points based on story reads and follows

What's the fun without fake internet points? Each user will get points based on the number of reads his/her stories has plus the number of applauds they have and also the number of follows one has. These points will be displayed on the profile page and will be displayed to all.

Comment System

This platform also lets you to comment on stories.

Create a book

What if your story is a book with many chapters? Well, You could just create a book and add chapters to it whenever you want. Users who follow the book get notification whenever a new chapter is added.

Follow Books

Follow certain books and get notifications whenever a new chapter is added by the writer.

Messaging System

You can personally message anyone on the platform to congratulate them or maybe give suggestions.

Bookmark System

Something caught your eye but you haven't got the time now? Bookmark and come back to find all your bookmarked stories easily.
